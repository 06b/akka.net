# Pigeon

*Alpha stage, do not use in production.*

###High performance Actor Model framework.
Pigeon is an unofficial port of the Scala/Java Akka actor model framework.

Why not Akka# or dotAkka? 
I simply assume that TypeSafe that makes Akka donâ€™t want to be associated with spare time projects like this, so I try not to stain their brand name.
Pigeon tries to stay as close to the Akka implementation as possible while still beeing .NET idiomatic.
