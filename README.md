# Akka.NET

Akka.NET is a port of the popular Java/Scala framework Akka to .NET.

Early beta, do not use in production!

This is a community driven port and is not affiliated with Typesafe who makes the original Java/Scala version.
The project was previously known as "Pigeon" before we got OK from Typesafe to use the name Akka.NET.
